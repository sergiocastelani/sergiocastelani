Graduated in Computer Science at UFSC, I have been on this software development journey for over 20 years.

I am inspired by innovation and I try to find alternatives that result in more efficiency and quality even in the simplest projects. So I learned to focus more on the pains that need to be solved than on a specific technology, keeping an open mind to research and identify the paths that bring the best results.

I had the opportunity to participate from startups that grew from 5 to 50 employees in a few years, to foreign companies with 40 years of experience. Therefore, despite having specialization in C++ and computer graphics with OpenGL, I had to face many subprojects, prototypes and researches where it was necessary to deal with all kinds of languages (C#, Java, Javascript, Python, Bash, Perl, ...), frameworks (Flask, Angular, Vue, Qt, boost, ...) or technologies (network interfaces, GPUs, VoIP, Raspberry, 3D cameras, computed tomography, ...).

I'm currently deepening my studies on web development at Growdev, in order to work better in this sector that only tends to grow.
